#academic

This repository holds the source code for a selection of academic projects. 
Information on each project is available in the README.md file included in 
each project's directory.  
The project's typically need to be built and run from a command line. Java
projects should work in any environment with an installed Java virtual machine.
C/C++ projects are typically written with Linux-specific libraries, and therefore
will only run under Linux (or, possibly other POSIX-compliant operating systems).
* _guestbook-client-server_:[Java] A multithreaded guestbook client/server project.
