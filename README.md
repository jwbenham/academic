#academic

This repository holds the source code for a selection of academic projects. 
Information on each project is available in the README.md file included in 
each project's directory.  

The project's typically need to be built and run from a command line. Java
projects should work in any environment with an installed Java virtual machine.
C/C++ projects are typically written with Linux-specific libraries, and therefore
will only run under Linux (or, possibly other POSIX-compliant operating systems).

In the following list of projects, each list item begins with the project name,
followed by the language(s) used to develop the project, and the operating
system(s) the project runs on.

* __guestbook-client-server [Java - Windows/Unix]__: A multithreaded guestbook 
client/server 
project.
* __chat-client-server [C - Unix]__: A multithreaded HTTP chat server, and an
HTTP client which will connect to either 1) an HTTP server to submit HTTP
requests, or 2) the accompanying HTTP chat server for chatting.
